### Changes Implemented:

1. **Scraper Independence**
   - Created a `BaseScraper` class that provides common functionality
   - Implemented isolated scrapers for each platform with fault tolerance
   - Each scraper runs independently and won't crash if others fail
   - Added try/catch wrappers around critical scraping functions

2. **Unified Integration Logic**
   - Created a central `scrapers/index.js` module that coordinates all scrapers
   - Added source registration system for extensibility
   - Implemented standardized opportunity structure with consistent source field
   - Deduplication by externalId + source to prevent duplicates

3. **UI Enhancements**
   - Added source badges next to opportunity titles
   - Implemented source-specific styling with color-coding
   - Created CSS classes for platform-specific visual cues
   - Updated opportunity cards to show source information

4. **Filter Logic**
   - Added source filter dropdown in opportunities page
   - Implemented filter buttons for each platform
   - Added category filtering with source-specific grouping
   - Filter operates on in-memory cached data for performance

5. **Fault Isolation**
   - Each scraper runs in isolation with its own error handling
   - Added proper error boundaries in all asynchronous operations
   - Implemented logging for debugging failures
   - Opportunity display works even if one platform fails

### Architecture Decisions:

1. **Class Inheritance vs. Composition**
   - Used inheritance for scrapers via the `BaseScraper` class
   - This provides code reuse while maintaining isolation
   - Each scraper can still override specific methods as needed

2. **Storage Strategy**
   - Each scraper stores opportunities in platform-specific keys
   - Also stores to a unified opportunities collection for display
   - Central scrapers registry maintains source metadata

3. **UI Implementation**
   - Added platform-specific CSS classes for visual distinction
   - Source badges are fully integrated into the opportunity card UI
   - Filter UI allows users to focus on opportunities from specific sources

### Next Steps:

1. Consider implementing a notifications system to alert users of new opportunities by source
2. Add analytics to track which sources provide the most relevant opportunities
3. Improve error recovery when platform HTML structures change
4. Consider adding more platforms in the future using the same architecture
