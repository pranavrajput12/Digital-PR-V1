# Digital PR Extension v6 Implementation Plan

## üéØ Three Major Issues to Address

### 1. **Main Popup Redesign** üé®
**Problem**: Current popup design is not visually appealing or user-friendly
**Goal**: Create a modern, intuitive, and professional popup interface

### 2. **Opportunities Display Fix** üìä
**Problem**: opportunities.html page shows empty cards, missing deadlines, incorrect titles/summaries
**Goal**: Ensure all scraped data displays correctly for all platforms (SourceBottle, Featured, Qwoted)

### 3. **Scraper Interface Consistency** üîÑ
**Problem**: Different scraper interfaces and popups for each platform
**Goal**: Implement consistent scraper UI across all platforms using SourceBottle's model

## üìã Phased Implementation Plan

### **Phase 1: Main Popup Redesign - Three Screen Architecture** (Priority: Medium)
**Why Third**: Visual improvements and better organization after core functionality is fixed

#### Core Concept: Three Distinct Screens
- **Screen 1**: SourceBottle (with category buttons)
- **Screen 2**: Qwoted (single scrape button)
- **Screen 3**: Featured (single scrape button)

#### Tasks:
1. **Design Architecture**
   - Create tabbed interface or navigation system
   - Design three distinct screens:
     - **SourceBottle Screen**: Keep current category grid (11 categories)
     - **Qwoted Screen**: Single prominent "Scrape Qwoted" button
     - **Featured Screen**: Single prominent "Scrape Featured" button
   - Unified navigation bar to switch between platforms

2. **Screen Layouts**
   - **Navigation Bar** (Top)
     - Three platform tabs/buttons
     - Active platform indicator
     - Platform logos/icons
   
   - **SourceBottle Screen**
     - Category grid (existing)
     - "View All Opportunities" button
     - Platform-specific actions
   
   - **Qwoted Screen**
     - Large "Scrape Qwoted Opportunities" button
     - Quick stats (if available)
     - "View Qwoted Opportunities" button
     - Last sync info
   
   - **Featured Screen**
     - Large "Scrape Featured Questions" button
     - Quick stats (if available)
     - "View Featured Opportunities" button
     - Last sync info

3. **Shared Elements** (Bottom of each screen)
   - "View All Opportunities" button
   - "Export CSV" button
   - "Send to Google Sheets" button
   - "Settings" button

4. **Implementation Details**
   - Modern CSS with platform-specific color schemes
   - Smooth transitions between screens
   - Consistent button styling
   - Visual feedback for actions
   - Responsive layout

5. **Testing**
   - Navigation between screens works smoothly
   - All buttons remain functional
   - Platform-specific actions work correctly
   - No functionality breaks

### **Phase 2: Opportunities Display Fix** (Priority: High)
**Why First**: Core functionality - users need to see their data
**Critical**: Scrapers work perfectly - ONLY fix display layer

#### Understanding:
- ‚úÖ **Scrapers are working perfectly**
- ‚úÖ **Data is being fetched correctly**
- ‚úÖ **Data is stored in Chrome storage**
- ‚ùå **Display layer is not reading/showing data properly**

#### Approach: Frontend-Only Fix
**See detailed plan**: `V6_DATA_DISPLAY_FIX_PLAN.md`

#### Summary:
1. **Analysis Only** (No code changes)
   - Document storage structure for each platform
   - Map field names from storage to display
   - Identify display bugs in opportunities.js

2. **Careful Display Fixes** (opportunities.js only)
   - Fix data retrieval from storage
   - Fix field mapping for each platform
   - Fix date formatting
   - Fix card population

3. **What We Will NOT Touch**:
   - ‚ùå Any scraper files
   - ‚ùå Content scripts
   - ‚ùå Background scripts
   - ‚ùå Storage writing logic

4. **Testing After Each Change**
   - Verify scrapers still work
   - Check data displays correctly
   - Ensure nothing breaks

---

### **Phase 3: Scraper Interface Consistency** (Priority: Medium-High)
**Why Third**: Builds on working data display

#### Tasks:
1. **SourceBottle UI Analysis**
   - Document the "perfect" popup structure
   - List all UI elements and behaviors
   - Create reusable component spec

2. **Unified Scraper Component**
   - Create base scraper UI component
   - Implement:
     - Status indicator
     - Progress bar
     - Page info (Page X of Y)
     - Next/Previous buttons
     - Start/Stop controls
     - Results counter

3. **Platform Integration**
   - Adapt Featured scraper to use unified UI
   - Adapt Qwoted scraper to use unified UI
   - Ensure consistent messaging

4. **Content Script Updates**
   - Update Featured content scripts
   - Update Qwoted content scripts
   - Implement consistent communication protocol

5. **Testing**
   - Test each platform's scraper
   - Verify progress tracking
   - Ensure navigation works
   - Test error states

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Measures

### For Each Phase:
1. **Backup before changes**
2. **Test in isolation**
3. **Incremental implementation**
4. **Rollback plan ready**
5. **User functionality never broken**

### Testing Protocol:
- ‚úÖ Extension loads without errors
- ‚úÖ All existing features work
- ‚úÖ Each platform scrapes correctly
- ‚úÖ Data saves properly
- ‚úÖ UI responds as expected
