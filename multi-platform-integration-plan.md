# Multi-Platform Integration Strategy

## Overview
This document outlines the strategy for integrating multiple PR opportunity platforms (SourceBottle, Quoted, and Featured.com) into our Chrome extension.

## Architecture Design

### Platform Manager System
- Create a centralized `PlatformManager` to handle platform-specific operations
- Implement a modular architecture where each platform has its own implementation
- Store platform-specific settings and credentials separately

### UI Architecture
- Tab-based navigation system for platform switching
- Platform-specific views with consistent UI patterns
- Credentials and settings management for each platform

## Component Breakdown

### 1. Platform-Specific Modules

```
/modules/platforms/
  - platformManager.js     # Core coordinator
  - sourcebottle/
    - scraper.js
    - transformer.js
    - authManager.js
  - quoted/
    - scraper.js
    - transformer.js
    - authManager.js
  - featured/
    - scraper.js
    - transformer.js
    - authManager.js
  - types.js               # Shared type definitions
```

Each platform module will:
- Handle authentication and session management
- Implement platform-specific scraping logic
- Transform platform-specific data to a common format
- Manage platform-specific settings

### 2. UI Components

#### Platform Tab Navigation
- Prominent tab interface at the top of the opportunities page
- Visual indicators for active platform
- Quick switching between platforms

#### Platform-Specific Settings Panels
- Each platform has its own settings section
- Credential management (username/password or API keys)
- Scraping preferences specific to each platform
- Category mapping configuration

#### Unified Opportunity View
- Consistent card design across platforms
- Platform-specific badges/indicators
- Filtering options specific to each platform

### 3. Storage Strategy

```javascript
// Example storage structure
{
  "platform_settings": {
    "sourcebottle": {
      "credentials": { ... },
      "categories": [ ... ],
      "scraping_interval": 60
    },
    "quoted": {
      "credentials": { ... },
      "categories": [ ... ],
      "scraping_interval": 30
    },
    "featured": {
      "credentials": { ... },
      "categories": [ ... ],
      "scraping_interval": 120
    }
  },
  "opportunities": {
    "sourcebottle": [ ... ],
    "quoted": [ ... ],
    "featured": [ ... ]
  }
}
```

- Separate opportunity storage by platform
- Unified AI analysis cache (when possible)
- Platform-specific user preferences

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation
1. Create the platform manager architecture
2. Implement tab-based UI navigation
3. Refactor existing SourceBottle code into platform-specific module
4. Develop storage isolation for multiple platforms

### Phase 2: Platform Integration
1. Implement Featured.com integration
   - Create authentication system
   - Develop scraper module
   - Build data transformer
   - Update UI for platform-specific features
2. Implement Quoted integration
   - Same components as Featured.com

### Phase 3: Unified Experience
1. Develop cross-platform search and filtering
2. Create platform-specific category management
3. Implement platform-specific AI enhancements
4. Build aggregated statistics and insights

## Technical Challenges

### Authentication Management
- Secure storage of multiple platform credentials
- Session management for each platform
- Handling authentication failures

### Data Transformation
- Converting different data structures to a common format
- Preserving platform-specific attributes
- Handling inconsistencies between platforms

### Performance Considerations
- Memory management with multiple platforms
- Background syncing strategies
- Cache optimization across platforms

### User Experience
- Maintaining consistency across platforms
- Clear indication of active platform
- Platform-specific feature discoverability

## Future Enhancements

### Cross-Platform Analytics
- Compare opportunity quality across platforms
- Identify platform-specific trends
- Suggest optimal platforms for specific goals

### Platform-Specific AI Tuning
- Train specialized AI models for each platform
- Platform-specific relevance scoring
- Custom feature extraction per platform
